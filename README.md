# lastweekly

First a little preamble.  

Go use tweekly.fm.  Really.  Scott (@ssxio) is a great guy and has put a lot of hard work into it.

### so why lastweekly?

A while back Scott was considering retiring tweekly.fm.  That would have been a sad day indeed.  In preparation for that I wrote a thing to replace it and it sat on my laptop.  This is that thing.

### genesis

In 2010 I wrote [toppr](https://github.com/kevinspencer/toppr) to post last.fm listening stats to a Movable Type based blog.  No one does that anymore, but that spark of an idea stuck with me.

### dogfooding

I've switched to using this in cron every Friday morning
