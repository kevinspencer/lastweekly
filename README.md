# lastweekly

First a little preamble.  

A hundred thousand years ago, before Elon broke Twitter, there was a service called tweekly.fm that posted your last.fm listing stats to your timeline.

### so why lastweekly?

The original author of tweakly.fm was considering retiring it.  That would have been a sad day indeed.  In preparation for that I wrote a thing to replace it and it sat on my laptop.  This is that thing, and lo it did work and the world was a happy place.

### and yet _not_ Twitter now?

No. Twitter API changes broke all kinds of things and I didn't have the tuits to figure it out.  And these days I'm not on Twitter anyway.

### behold the Wordpress!

The upcoming versions of lastweekly will support posting to Wordpress

### genesis

In 2010 I wrote [toppr](https://github.com/kevinspencer/toppr) to post last.fm listening stats to a Movable Type based blog.  No one does that anymore because Movable Type RIP.  But the idea stuck with me.

### dogfooding

I've switched to using this in cron every Friday morning
